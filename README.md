# International Tourism Arrivals Map (Tableau Project)

This is a simple data visualization project I built using Tableau. It shows the number of international tourist arrivals by country from 2015 to 2020, based on data from the World Bank.

## What it does

The main visualization is a filled world map where each country is color-coded based on the number of tourist arrivals for a given year. You can hover over each country to see the exact number of visitors, the country name, and the year. There’s also an option to filter or animate the data year by year.

## Files in this repo

- `tourism_arrivals.twbx` – Tableau workbook file (contains the data and the map)
- `tourism_clean.csv` – The cleaned CSV I used for the visualization

## Data source

The data comes from the World Bank:  
[International tourism, number of arrivals – World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.ARVL)

## How to open it

You’ll need Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public (desktop version) to open the `.twbx` file. Just download the file and open it directly in Tableau.

## Why I built this

This was my first project in Tableau. I wanted to get more comfortable working with real-world data, cleaning and transforming it, and building something that tells a clear story visually. I learned how to pivot data, build filled maps, use tooltips, and animate time-based data.
